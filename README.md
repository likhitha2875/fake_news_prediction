# fake_news_prediction

 Overview
This project builds an efficient Fake News Detection System using:

TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams

Passive-Aggressive Classifier (faster, scalable alternative to traditional logistic regression)

NLP preprocessing (stemming, stopword removal)

The system predicts whether a news article is real or fake with high accuracy, making it suitable for deployments in news verification systems, journalism, and social media monitoring.

 Features
 ✅ High-accuracy (~98-99%) fake news classification
 ✅ Uses Passive-Aggressive online learning for faster training on large datasets
 ✅ Colab-compatible and GPU-friendly
 ✅ Clean pipeline structure for easy understanding and extension
 ✅ Preprocessing using NLTK for noise reduction
 ✅ Scalable for real-time detection pipelines
